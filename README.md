# Password Generator Starter Code
Here is my example of a password generator using the given html, css and javascript starter code.
Using objects and DOM elements I was able to use javascript to select my HTML elements by ID and created functions for each element.

## Notes
I am still learning how to properly use all of the functions and creating them from scratch was not too bad, I added multiple elements to the HTML code for all of my javascript to select.
